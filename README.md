# Ebitengine Game Jam -- Magnetism

idea: isometric magnet fishing

incorporate magnetism a central mechanic via proximity feedback

why are you fishing? to construct a boat made of scrap to escape

can catch parts (scrap) that can be either invested towards the win or passive income (via sensors and electromagnets)

parts include:
- generic metal scrap (ex wrenches, sheet metal, bolts)
- electric scrap
- wire

electric + wire = sensor
electric + metal = electromagnet
metal + wire = antenna (win condition)

scrap is spawned in on a proimity basis
